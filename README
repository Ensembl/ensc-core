EnsC core
=========
Aim: To replicate the ensembl core API in C.

Warning: This code is in the early stages of development. Do not 
         expect it to contain all the API methods, or in fact to
         work in any way at all.

To see it in action:
cd src
./autogen.sh
./runconfig
make
Tests/DBAdaptorTest


Some of the programs will not be compiled if their dependencies
are not found (runconfig will give a warning if this is the case).
If dependencies are installed in a non-standard location then 
you can point runconfig to it as follows:

./runconfig CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib"
